System requirements
===================

.. list-table::
   :widths: 3 7
   :header-rows: 0
   :class: tight-table

   * - Operating system
     - KGGSEE runs in a Java Virtual Machine. It does not matter which operating system it runs in.
   * - Java Runtime Environment
     - A Java SE Runtime Environment of version 1.8 or higher is needed.
   * - CPU
     - A CPU with four cores or more is recommended.
   * - Memory
     - 16 GB RAM or higher is recommended.
   * - Free space
     - KGGSEE and related datasets may take up to 10 GB.


Setup the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
========================================

KGGSEE needs JRE 1.8 or higher to run. Both `Java(TM) SE JRE <https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp>`_ and `OpenJDK JRE <https://openjdk.java.net/install>`_ are competent for KGGSEE. Please follow the instructions on the websites to complete the installation and also add Java to the system PATH.

Check the JRE by entering ``java -version`` in a Terminal of Linux or MacOS, or CMD or PowerShell of Windows. If it displays the JRE version like ``Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_xxx)`` or ``OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_xxx)``, it means the JRE has already been set up. Otherwise, check if JRE has been installed and if Java is in the system PATH.


Setup KGGSEE
============

Download the bundled file of ``kggsee.jar``, running resource dataset and quick tutorial dataset from `the download page <http://pmglab.top/kggsee/#/download>`_ and unzip.

The running resource dataset includes:

     - The gene-level expression profile of the `GTEx v8 <https://www.gtexportal.org/home/>`_ tissues
   * - ``resources/gtex.v8.transcript.mean.tsv.gz``
     - The transcript-level expression profile of the `GTEx v8 <https://www.gtexportal.org/home/>`_ tissues 
   * - ``resources/HCL_scRNA_cluster_mean.tsv.gz`` 
     - The expression profile of cell clusters generated from scRNA-seq dataset of the `Human Cell Landscape <bis.zju.edu.cn/HCL/>`_
   * - ``resources/*.symbols.gmt.gz``
     - `MSigDB <http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp>`_ gene sets


The tutorial dataset includes:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1 1
   :header-rows: 0
   :class: tight-table
   
   * - ``tutorials/scz_gwas_eur_chr1.tsv.gz``
     - Summary statistics of chr1 SNPs for a GWAS of schizophrenia on the European population
   * - ``tutorials/1kg_hg19_eur_chr1.vcf.gz``
     - Genotypes of chr1 SNPs sampled from the 1000 Genome Project European population
   * - ``tutorials/GTEx_v8_gene_BrainBA9.eqtl.txt.gz``
     - Summary statistics of eQTLs calculated from gene-level expression profile of GTEx v8 brain BA9
   * - ``tutorials/GTEx_v8_transcript_BrainBA9.eqtl.txt.gz``
     - Summary statistics of eQTLs calculated from transcript-level expression profile of GTEx v8 brain BA9


For running customized analyses, the following data is needed, refer to :ref:`Detailed Document <detailed_document>` for descriptions of file formats.

* A file of GWAS summary statistics of the phenotype to be studied.

* VCF files of genotypes sampled from the population of the GWAS to be studied. Genotypes of the 1000 Genomes Project Phase3 v5 can be downloaded from the `NCBI FTP site <ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/release/20130502>`_ or the `1000 Genomes Project FTP site <ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502>`_.

* A file of eQTL summary statistics calculated from target tissues may be used. We provide gene-based and transcript-based eQTL summary statistics for GTEx v8 tissues available for download (refer to `the download page <http://pmglab.top/kggsee/#/download>`_).
