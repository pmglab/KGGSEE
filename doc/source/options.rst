The options for :ref:`Reference population genotypes <option_vcf>`, :ref:`GWAS summary statistics <option_gwas>`, and :ref:`Miscellaneous global options <option_misc>` act on all analyses. For clarity, we have categorized the other parameters by :ref:`Gene-based association and heritability <option_assoc>`, :ref:`DESE <option_dese>` and :ref:`EMIC <option_emic>`, although this has resulted in some duplication of parameters.

In the "Default" columns of the following tables, "null" denotes that the flag works with an argument but there is no default value; "n/a" denotes that the flag works without an argument.


.. _option_vcf:

Reference population genotypes

These options work on the VCF file of reference population genotypes. Only SNPs that pass the filters will be used for subsequent analyses. These options act on all analyses.


.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 3 8 1
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: tight-table


   * - Flag
     - Description
     - Default
   * - ``--vcf-ref``
     - Specifies a VCF file of genotypes sampled from a reference population. These genotypes are used to estimate LD correlation coefficients among SNPs. For VCF files of separated chromosomes, use wildcards with quotes like ``"chr*.vcf.gz"``.
     - null
   * - ``--keep-ref``
     - Keep the parsed VCF files as KGGSEE object format in a folder named ``VCFRefhg*`` under the output folder.
